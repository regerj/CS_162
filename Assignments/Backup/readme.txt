Program: LL_Test

Description: This program test the implementation
of my from-scratch linked list class. It will 
construct a linked list object and prompt the user
to fill it with as many values as they wish. It will
then print their linked list, and ask them which order
they wish to sort the list in. It will then sort the 
list, and print it again. It will then tell the user 
how many prime numbers are in the list, before
clearing the list and prompting the user to do it
again.

Input: Inputs include the data values to be stored
in each of the nodes of the linked list, a 
confirmation that the user wishes to enter another
data point, whether the user wants to sort in
ascending or descending order, and finally if the
user wants to run the program again.

Output: Outputs include basic interface outputs and 
the linked list.

Notes:

This program is packaged with functionality to insert
new nodes anywhere in the linked list, as well as
a push_front function which can push a new node onto
the front of the linked list. This functionality is
not displayed during runtime. All inputs are error
handled, and reprompt you for valid inputs. Make sure
to type in choices as they are shown on the screen.
All swaps, pushes, and sorts are perfomed using the 
pointer variable of the nodes, and does not touch 
the actual values after they have been set. No extra 
credit was attempted on this assignment. It should be 
noted that I created my own simple prime number 
detector, which may or may not be efficient when 
dealing with very large numbers. That was not a 
requirement of the rubric however, and I felt it would 
be good practice to use my own prime number detector 
rather then a library that included a potentially more 
efficient version. Hope everything works for you! 

Thank you so much for a great term!!!!
